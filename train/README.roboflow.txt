The dataset includes 412 images.
Vehicles are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit within)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -21 and +21 degrees
* Random shear of between -31째 to +31째 horizontally and -31째 to +31째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -31 and +31 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 9 percent of pixels
